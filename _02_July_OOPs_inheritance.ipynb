        "Inheritance is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), the other three being encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Inheritance allows a class (the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit attributes and behaviors (i.e., fields and methods) from another class (the \"superclass\" or \"base class\").\n",

        "**Base Class (Superclass)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Why Use Inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of rewriting the same code again in a new class, a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. This allows for the \"don't repeat yourself\" (DRY) principle, making the code more maintainable.A derived class can extend or override functionalities of the base class, which allows for creating extended functionalities without modifying the existing code in the base class.It helps in establishing a natural classification among objects. For example, if you have a base class Vehicle, you can have derived classes like Car, Bike, or Truck, all inheriting from Vehicle."

        "In object-oriented programming, inheritance allows a class to be derived from another class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors. Depending on the programming paradigm and language, a class may inherit from one class (single inheritance) or multiple classes (multiple inheritance). Let's dive into the details of both concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Single Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one superclass. Most object-oriented programming languages, such as Java and C#, support single inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Single inheritance is easier to understand and use, especially for beginners. There's a clear parent-child relationship between the base class and derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code structure remains more manageable, and tracing method calls or attribute access is more straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's no confusion about where a particular method or attribute comes from since there's only one possible source: the parent class.\n",

        "**Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one superclass. C++ and Python are examples of languages that support multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to combine attributes and behaviors from multiple sources, potentially leading to a richer and more diverse derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of creating long chains of class hierarchies to inherit from multiple sources, a class can directly inherit from all necessary superclasses.\n",
        "\n",

        "Single Inheritance: One superclass.\n",

        "**Complexity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Inheritance: Generally simpler with less potential for ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Inheritance: Can lead to complex structures and the \"diamond problem\" (a situation where a particular class inherits the same base class from multiple paths).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Cases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Inheritance: Preferred when there's a clear linear relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Inheritance: Useful in situations where a class genuinely needs to exhibit behaviors from multiple unrelated classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Language Support:**\n",

        "Single Inheritance: Supported in languages like Java, C#, etc.\n",
